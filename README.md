# JobTrail

![JobTrail — Track. Discover. Land.](./docs/jobtrail-banner.png)

A self-hosted job-application tracker with a JobSpy-powered discovery pipeline
and a keyless company-enrichment layer (Wikipedia + Wikidata + SEC EDGAR).

JobTrail started as **Phase 1 of the [AI Job Application Tracker spec](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md)** —
FR-1 through FR-7 (CRUD, multi-round timeline, skills extraction, notes, search,
deadline reminders) plus a one-click **Discover** flow that pulls jobs from
LinkedIn / Indeed / Glassdoor / Google / ZipRecruiter via
[python-jobspy](https://github.com/speedyapply/JobSpy). It has since grown
companion features around each application: enriched company profiles, a
disambiguation picker, a unified activity log (status changes + free-form
notes), industry/job-type filters, and a danger-zone data reset.

Everything runs locally behind `docker compose up`. No auth, no external LLM
calls — enrichment uses public keyless APIs only.

## Features by page

### Dashboard — `/`
<img width="2546" height="1307" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de6e89b8-c7e1-4853-92c2-66058a48e615" />

The home page. Sortable table of every tracked application.

- **Columns**: Company → `/companies/:id`, Position → `/jobs/:id`, Status pill, Applied date, Job type, Tags. Every column header sorts ascending/descending on click; dates sort newest-first by default, everything else alphabetical.
- **Deadline badge** inline on company name — amber/red countdown when `deadline` is within the next week, gray when past.
- **Filters** (six along the search bar):
  - Free-text `q` — substring across company + position + description
  - Status dropdown
  - Tag filter (exact match against the application's `tags[]` array)
  - **Industry filter** — comma-separated → OR-matched (substring, case-insensitive) against the linked Company's `industry` field. `petroleum, consulting` returns applications at either kind of company.
  - **Job type** dropdown (Full-time / Part-time / Contract / Internship)
- **"+ Add Job"** button routes to the create form.

### Discover — `/discover`
<img width="2506" height="1303" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a00a89e-d229-47fb-b875-54e6e5aa1982" />

JobSpy-backed search across LinkedIn / Indeed / Glassdoor / Google / ZipRecruiter. Identical queries are cached for 10 minutes in the sidecar to avoid rate-limit pain.

- **Site checkboxes** — pick any subset of the five sources
- **Search term** + **location** (free text)
- **Results wanted** (1–200), **Max age** in hours
- **Remote only** checkbox
- **Job type** dropdown — passed to JobSpy's native `job_type` param (Full-time / Part-time / Contract / Internship)
- **Include keywords** *(client-side post-filter)* — comma-separated; if any one matches the title + company + description (case-insensitive substring), the row is kept
- **Exclude keywords** *(client-side post-filter)* — comma-separated; if any one matches, the row is hidden. **Excludes always win** over includes — handy for "search Junior Architect but hide cloud/aws/devops noise"
- **Counter** shows `Showing N of M (K hidden by filter)` whenever a filter is active
- **Import button** per row — POSTs to `/api/discover/import` which upserts on `(source, sourceJobId)`, auto-resolves a Company row, and kicks off background enrichment. Re-importing the same row refreshes URL/salary/location/description but never overwrites your status or notes.

### Companies — `/companies`
<img width="2549" height="1305" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/821b2813-4b3d-4deb-8e61-2c1cf34ed212" />

Card grid of every Company row your imports have created or you've manually linked. Useful for spotting "I've applied to 4 different oil-and-gas firms" patterns.

- **Card content per company**: Clearbit logo (monogram fallback for unknown domains), name, application count badge (`3 apps`), industry · HQ · founded year, two-line description preview
- **Search** — client-side substring filter over name, industry, and HQ location
- Click a card → `/companies/:id`

### Company Detail — `/companies/:id`
<img width="2551" height="1309" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/253d88fc-ee26-42b8-9d5d-32dd6d7bd458" />

Full enriched profile for one company.

- **Logo + name + verified badge** (if confirmed by you via the picker on a JobDetail)
- **Description** (from Wikipedia), formatted plain text
- **Facts**: founded year, employee count, revenue ($X.XB, with `(FYxxxx)` tag), website
- **Last updated** timestamp + comma-separated `sources` list (`wikipedia, wikidata, edgar`)
- **Refresh button** — re-runs the full enrichment pipeline on demand
- **Wikipedia link** when present
- **Applications list** — every JobApplication linked to this company, with position name and current status pill, ordered by most recently updated

### Activity — `/activity`

Global feed of everything that's happened to your tracker, newest first. Capped at 500 items.

- **Status changes** — auto-logged whenever an application's status flips. Renders `Old → New` with colored pills. Initial creation appears as `Created as <status>`.
- **Notes** — your free-form text entries (see JobDetail).
- **Dots** — cyan for notes (user-driven), slate for status events (system-driven). Same visual convention as the per-job timeline.
- Each row includes a link back to the source application.

### Job Detail — `/jobs/:id`
<img width="2521" height="1310" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c7626f7-b3b6-44a4-a4bd-65f60b10275c" />

Full picture of a single application. Roughly in order down the page:

- **Header card**
  - Application status overview (`In Progress (Round 2/3) | Next: 2026-06-01`)
  - Company name → `/companies/:id`
  - Position, deadline badge, location, remote icon, job type, source listing URL
  - Status pill + status dropdown (changing the status here auto-logs an event in the timeline below)
  - Edit / Delete buttons
- **Company panel**
  - Three visual states driven by `companyMatchStatus`:
    - **auto** — enriched data + small "Is this the right company? ✓ Yes / ✗ Wrong" prompt
    - **confirmed** — enriched data + ✓ verified badge, no prompt
    - **rejected** — picker UI replaces the panel; "Restore auto-match" link to revert
  - Polls every 3s after import until enrichment lands, then stops
  - Refresh button re-runs all three sources
- **Activity card** — unified timeline of status changes + your notes, interleaved by date
  - **Textarea + Add note** button at the top — free-form text, up to 10k chars
  - Below, the merged log. Hover any note to reveal a delete button.
- **Rounds card** — ASCII-tree interview timeline (`├─ ./`)
  - Add round, edit any round (type / status / scheduled at / duration / interviewer / notes), delete
- **Skills chips** — categorized auto-extracted skills (languages, frameworks, databases, cloud, tools); editable
- **Description** — collapsible `<details>` block with the full job posting

### Add Job / Edit Job — `/jobs/new` and `/jobs/:id/edit`
<img width="2511" height="1212" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29efd464-1052-482e-843a-6a04d136dbe3" />

Single form, used for both creation and editing.

- Company *(required)*, Position *(required)*
- Source (`manual` by default; otherwise `linkedin`/`indeed`/`glassdoor`/`google`/`ziprecruiter`)
- Job URL, Location, Remote checkbox
- **Job type** dropdown
- Salary min / max / currency
- Applied at, Deadline (calendar pickers)
- Tags — autocomplete via TagInput (suggests from your `recentTags` settings)
- Status dropdown
- Description — pasting in a job posting triggers skill extraction on save

### Settings — `/settings`
<img width="2514" height="1305" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0359a83e-532c-4948-87d0-0ab19f73c7c6" />

Per-user preferences and destructive actions.

- **Contact email** *(required)* — used solely in the `User-Agent` header sent to upstream enrichment APIs. SEC EDGAR 403s requests without a real email per their fair-use policy. Until this is set, a prominent amber banner appears on every page linking back here.
- **Date format** — affects display of every date in the app (Applied, Deadline, Scheduled, etc). Preview row shows the chosen pattern formatted against today.
- **Recently used tags** — read-only list of the 50 most recent tags you've added. Powers the TagInput autocomplete on the Add/Edit form.
- **Danger zone — Reset all data**
  - Wipes job_applications, interview_rounds, job_status_events, job_notes, companies
  - Preserves your settings row (date format, recent tags, contact email)
  - Optional checkbox: also clear the 7-day HTTP enrichment cache
  - Type `DELETE_ALL_DATA` in the confirm field before the destructive button enables — same string the backend validator checks, so typo-proof
  - On success, a summary modal reports counts: `7 applications · 14 rounds · 21 status events · 5 companies cleared`

## Company enrichment pipeline

Every application is auto-linked at import (or manual create) to a `Company` row. A background pipeline pulls public-data facts from three keyless sources, in order:

| Source | Provides | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Wikipedia** | description, logo image, Wikipedia URL | Direct title lookup → falls back to OpenSearch when the direct one 404s or is a disambiguation page |
| **Wikidata** | employees, revenue, founded year, HQ city, industry, official website, Wikidata QID, logo URL | Two-pass candidate selection: description keyword scan first, then P31 (`instance of`) verification on the top hit. SPARQL query for the structured facts. Non-USD revenue keeps the currency QID but never converts (no FX guessing). |
| **SEC EDGAR** | revenue (USD), employee count, SIC industry, HQ city/state, CIK | Only matches US public companies via a normalized-name → CIK lookup against `company_tickers.json`. Pulls the most recent **10-K annual** value, walking `RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax` → `Revenues` → `SalesRevenueNet` in priority order. Requires a contact email in the UA. |

Dedup uses a **normalized-name** key (lowercase, suffix-stripped: `Chevron Corp.` / `Chevron Corporation` / `CHEVRON` → `chevron`) plus a **Jaro-Winkler fuzzy fallback** at threshold 0.92 for near-misses (typos, suffix variants the regex doesn't catch).

A weekly **cron** (Sundays 03:00) refreshes the 50 stalest companies and force-refreshes the EDGAR ticker cache. HTTP responses are cached in Postgres for 7 days to keep dev iteration cheap and avoid hammering upstreams.

When the system picks the wrong entity ("Apple" → Apple Inc when you meant Apple Records), the JobDetail Company panel has a rejection flow with a Wikidata-backed search picker. Rejections stick — once you say "wrong company", subsequent imports of the same source row will never auto-relink.

```

The `jobspy` sidecar is intentionally Python-only: JobSpy is a Python project
that scrapes per-site HTML/APIs. Porting it to TypeScript would be a multi-week
undertaking and would lose upstream maintenance.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop / Docker Engine 24+ with Compose v2
- 2 GB free RAM, 2 GB free disk

That's it — no Node / Python / Postgres needed on the host.

## Quick start — try it without cloning

If you just want to spin up JobTrail with no setup, grab the prebuilt-image compose file from this repo and run it. Multi-arch images cover Intel/AMD, Apple Silicon, and ARM SBCs.

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaylaehman/jobtrail/main/compose.hub.yml
docker compose -f compose.hub.yml up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. First-time DB init + migrations takes ~30 seconds. To stop and remove the volume:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.hub.yml down -v
```

The images live at <https://hub.docker.com/u/kaylaehman> — `jobtrail-frontend`, `jobtrail-backend`, `jobtrail-jobspy`. Pinning a specific build is just `JOBTRAIL_IMAGE_TAG=sha-abc1234 docker compose -f compose.hub.yml up -d`.

## Run from source (dev / local builds)

```sh
cp .env.example .env          # optional, only if you want to override defaults
docker compose up --build
```

| Service        | URL                                  | Notes                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Frontend       | http://localhost:3000                | React app                     |
| Backend API    | http://localhost:8000/api/health     | NestJS                        |
| JobSpy sidecar | _internal_ (compose network)         | Reachable only from backend   |
| Postgres       | _internal_ (compose network)         | Persisted in `jobtrail_pgdata`|

On first boot the backend runs `prisma migrate deploy` against an empty database.
The dashboard starts empty — add jobs via **+ Add Job** or import them from the
**Discover** tab.

---

## Verifying each functional requirement

After `docker compose up`, open <http://localhost:3000> and click through:

| FR   | Feature                            | How to verify                                                                                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FR-1 | Job CRUD                           | Dashboard → **+ Add Job** → fill the form → save. Edit/delete from the application detail page.       |
| FR-2 | Multi-round progress tracking      | Add a job, open it, then click **+ Add round** on the Rounds card. The §8.2 ASCII-tree timeline shows numbered rounds with status icons.|
| FR-3 | Save job description / requirements| Paste the description into the Add-job form's "Description / requirements" field — it persists.        |
| FR-4 | AI skills extraction               | Pasting a description triggers the local NLP extractor and shows §8.3 categorized chips.               |
| FR-5 | Notes & feedback per round         | On the detail page, hover any timeline round → ✏️ Edit → update the Notes textarea → Save. Free-form per-application notes also live in the **Activity** card.|
| FR-6 | Search & filter                    | Dashboard top bar: free-text `q`, status, tag, industry (comma-multi), job type.                       |
| FR-7 | Deadline reminders                 | Add a job and set its deadline within the next week → an amber "🟡 Due in Nd" badge appears on the dashboard.  |
| New  | JobSpy discovery                   | **Discover** tab → pick sites → search → **Save to tracker** to import.                                |

---

## How JobSpy queries work

The Discover form POSTs to `/api/discover/search`, which the backend forwards
to the `jobspy` sidecar at `http://jobspy:8001/search`. The sidecar calls
`jobspy.scrape_jobs(...)`, flattens the pandas DataFrame into JSON, and caches
the result keyed on the normalized (sites, term, location, limit, hours, remote,
job-type) tuple for `JOBSPY_CACHE_TTL` seconds (default 600).

```
POST /api/discover/search
{
  "sites": ["linkedin", "indeed"],
  "searchTerm": "senior backend engineer",
  "location": "Berlin",
  "resultsWanted": 25,
  "hoursOld": 72,
  "isRemote": true,
  "jobType": "fulltime"
}
```

Saving a row calls `/api/discover/import`, which upserts on
`(source, sourceJobId)`. Re-importing the same row refreshes
URL/salary/location/description but never overwrites your status or notes.

### LinkedIn rate-limit caveat

From [python-jobspy's README](https://github.com/speedyapply/JobSpy#frequently-asked-questions):

> LinkedIn is the most restrictive: rate-limits hit around the 10th page per IP.

If you plan to query LinkedIn heavily, set `JOBSPY_PROXIES` in `.env` to a
comma-separated list of `host:port` (or `user:pass@host:port`) entries:

```
JOBSPY_PROXIES=user:pass@proxy1.example.com:8080,user:pass@proxy2.example.com:8080
```

JobSpy will rotate through them. For light use the 10-minute query cache built
into the sidecar is usually enough.

---

## Development without Docker

If you want hot-reload while editing:

```sh
# postgres + jobspy via compose, backend + frontend on the host
docker compose up db jobspy

# backend
cd backend
npm install
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://jobtrail:jobtrail@localhost:5432/jobtrail JOBSPY_URL=http://localhost:8001 \
  npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run start:dev

# frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 npm run dev
```

(That requires exposing port 5432 on the `db` service and 8001 on `jobspy` in a
local override — not done by default for security.)

---

## Tests

```sh
# backend
cd backend && npm test

# frontend
cd frontend && npm test
```

Backend has Jest unit specs for:

- `JobsService` (CRUD, status-event auto-logging, auto-link to Company on create)
- `RoundsService`, `SkillsService` (`findSkillInContext` against tricky cases: `react` vs `reacted`, `go` vs `google`, `c++` with its punctuation)
- `DiscoverService` (delegates to JobsService, gates company resolution on `auto` status, skips `confirmed` / `rejected`)
- `CompaniesService` (domain match, normalized-name match, Jaro-Winkler fuzzy fallback, short-name skip)
- `name-normalizer` (Chevron-variants collapse, AT&T preserved, idempotency)
- `EnrichmentService` (first-wins merge, per-field provenance, per-source error isolation)
- `WikipediaSource`, `WikidataSource`, `EdgarSource`, `EdgarTickerCache` (each with mocked-HTTP fixtures covering happy path + the source-specific edge cases)

Frontend has a Vitest + Testing Library smoke test on `DeadlineBadge`.

## Deploying to a homelab with Portainer + Cloudflare Tunnel

JobTrail ships a second compose file, `docker-compose.portainer.yml`, tuned for
a Git-based Portainer stack with [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared)
in front. The browser only sees one origin (your Cloudflare hostname); the
frontend's nginx reverse-proxies `/api/*` to the backend container over the
compose network, so there's no CORS, no exposed backend port, and no TLS for
you to terminate.

### 1. Cloudflare Tunnel — add a Public Hostname

In the Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard, on the tunnel that runs on your
homelab:

- **Subdomain / Domain**: e.g. `jobtrail` / `yourdomain.com`
- **Service type**: `HTTP`
- **URL**: `<homelab-ip>:3000` (or whatever you set `JOBTRAIL_FRONTEND_PORT` to)

That's the only mapping needed — everything else is internal to the compose
network.

### 2. Portainer — create the stack

In Portainer: **Stacks → Add stack → Git repository**.

| Field                | Value                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name                 | `jobtrail`                                                   |
| Repository URL       | `https://github.com/kaylaehman/jobtrail`                     |
| Repository reference | `refs/heads/main`                                            |
| Compose path         | `docker-compose.portainer.yml`                               |
| Enable auto-update   | optional — polls the repo and redeploys on commits           |

### 3. Set stack environment variables

In the **Environment variables** section of the stack form:

| Var                       | Required? | Notes                                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`       | yes       | The compose file errors out if this isn't set.              |
| `JOBSPY_PROXIES`          | optional  | Comma-sep proxy list for python-jobspy, per LinkedIn caveat. |
| `JOBTRAIL_FRONTEND_PORT`  | optional  | Default `3000`. Must match the URL in your Cloudflare Tunnel mapping. |
| `JOBTRAIL_CONTACT_EMAIL`  | optional  | Pre-seeds the contact email used in SEC EDGAR's `User-Agent`. UI-side **Settings → Contact email** always overrides this; the env var only matters if you want EDGAR enrichment to work the very first time the stack boots, before any user has visited Settings. |
| `POSTGRES_USER`           | optional  | Default `jobtrail`.                                         |
| `POSTGRES_DB`             | optional  | Default `jobtrail`.                                         |
| `JOBSPY_CACHE_TTL`        | optional  | Default `600` seconds.                                      |
| `JOBTRAIL_IMAGE_NAMESPACE`| optional  | Docker Hub user/org that owns the published images. Default `kaylaehman`. Change if you forked and republish under your own account. |
| `JOBTRAIL_IMAGE_TAG`      | optional  | Default `latest`. Pin to a `sha-<commit>` tag to roll back. |

Click **Deploy the stack**. The Portainer compose file references pre-built
multi-arch images from Docker Hub (`kaylaehman/jobtrail-{backend,frontend,jobspy}`),
so the first deploy just **pulls** rather than building from source — typically
under a minute. The images themselves are produced by the `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`
GitHub Action on every push to `main`.

If you've forked the repo and want to publish under your own Docker Hub account:

1. Create a Docker Hub access token with **Read+Write** scope at <https://hub.docker.com/settings/security>.
2. Add two GitHub secrets to your fork (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` — your Docker Hub handle
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` — the token from step 1
3. Push any change to `main` to trigger the workflow. After it succeeds, three repositories appear under your Docker Hub account.
4. Set `JOBTRAIL_IMAGE_NAMESPACE=<your-handle>` in the Portainer stack env vars.

### 4. Verify

- Visit `https://jobtrail.yourdomain.com` — the dashboard loads, three seeded
  applications are visible, and the **Discover** tab can hit JobSpy.
- Portainer's per-container logs should show `prisma migrate deploy` completing
  and `[jobtrail-backend] listening on :8000`.

### Cloudflared in the same Docker stack (optional)

If cloudflared already runs as a container on this host, you can drop the
host-port binding and put both stacks on a shared docker network. The bottom of
`docker-compose.portainer.yml` has a commented block showing how — point the
tunnel at `http://frontend:80` instead of `http://<homelab-ip>:3000`.

## Swedish discovery extension

This fork adds Sweden/Denmark country forwarding, Platsbanken through the
[official JobSearch API](https://jobsearch.api.jobtechdev.se/), and partner adverts through
[JobAd Links](https://links.api.jobtechdev.se/). JobAd Links descriptions stay short and
advert links point to the original listing. No API key is required.

Discover searches sources independently and shows source failures alongside completed
results. Official APIs have separate bounded workers from JobSpy, so blocked scrapers do
not consume their workers. Load more uses the submitted query, even if form fields change.
Imports deduplicate within each source; they do not group the same vacancy across sources.

Country defaults to Sweden. For official sources, Location accepts an exact Swedish
municipality, optionally followed by Sweden; leave it blank for the selected country.
JobAd Links cannot filter remote work or job type. JobSearch supports full-time and
part-time here. Unsupported filters produce source warnings rather than silently widening
searches. English role names are not translated; Swedish terms can yield different matches.

`JOBSPY_PROXIES` is required for every external search. Starting positions rotate across
short searches, and each source uses the existing request-level JobSpy proxy rotation.
This does not add proxy health checks or automatic failover. Empty scraper results remain
unconfirmed because JobSpy can swallow collection errors.

The Dockerfiles extend the original deployed runtime digests and install locked build
dependencies. Build and test linux/amd64 images locally with:

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t jobtrail-wl7r-backend:swedish-discovery backend
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t jobtrail-wl7r-frontend:swedish-discovery frontend
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t jobtrail-wl7r-jobspy:swedish-discovery jobspy-service
```

Back up PostgreSQL before applying the additive JobSource enum migration. After importing
the new sources, retain a compatible backend or review a data migration before downgrading.
